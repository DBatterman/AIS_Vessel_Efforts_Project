# AIS Vessel Efforts Project

## Overview 

### What Topic We Selected

The topic we selected is seeing which types of maritime vessels use various waterways. We hope to see current usage by filtering the data we obtain, and predict future usage using supervised machine learning. Our scope right now is the San Franscio Bay Area, but this code can be easily tweaked to examine other areas.

### Reason We Selected the Topic

We believe this is an interesting topic with lots of practical applications. By viewing the type of traffic in specific waterways, we can see exactly what kinds of permits need to be given out for ships to travel. It can also help determine a need for new channels, as the machine learning model will show the traffic demands for ships in the future.
